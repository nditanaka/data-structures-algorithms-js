/**
 * Hash tables are unordered collections of key-value pairs. 
 * Access/ retrieval time - O(1). They have random access like an array.
 * Insertion/ deletion - O(n)
 * Applications - log files.
 * can be implemented with an array where the key of each data item is used to calculate the index using a hashing function. This makes the index of each element related to the data itself.
