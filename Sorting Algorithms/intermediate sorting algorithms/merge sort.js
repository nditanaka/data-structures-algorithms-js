/**
 * MERGE SORT
 * a combination of two things - merging and sorting.
 * It exploits the fact that arrays of length 0 or 1 are always sorted.
 * It works by decomposing an array into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements then building up a newly sorted array.
 * 
 * HELPER FUNCTION
 * it is useful to first implement a helper function for merging two sorted arrays.
 * Given two arrays that are sorted, this helper function should create a new array which is also sorted, and consists 
 * of all the elements in the two input arrays.
 * This function should run in O(n+m) time and O(n+m) space and should not modify the parameters passed to it where n and m
 * are the lengths of input arrays n and m respectively
 * 
 * PSEUDOCODE for merge helper function
 * Create an empty array, take a look at the smallest values in each input array. While there are still values we have not
 * looked at: 
 *          - if the value in the first array is smaller than the value in the second array, push the value in the first array
 *            into our results and move on to the next value in the first array.
 *          - if the value in the first array is larger than the value in the second array, push the value in the second array
 *            into our results and move on to the next value in the second array.
 *          - once we exhaust one array, push in all remaining values from the other array.
