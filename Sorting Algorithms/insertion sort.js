/**
 * 
 * INSERTION SORT
 * similar to bubble sort, and selection sort but instead of placing large values into sorted position 
 * (bubble sort) or small values into sorted position at the beginning (selection sort), 
 * insertion sort builds up a sorted array by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted
 * insertion sort inserts each element of the array into it's correct sorted position
 * 
 * time complexity : O(n^2)
 * space complexity: O(1). Selection sort is better than bubble sort if you're worried about the number of memory write operations.
 * PSEUDOCODE
 * Start by picking the selected element in the array
 * Now compare the second element with the one before it and swap if necessary
 * Continue to the next element and if it is in 
 */

/** 
 * it is considered an online algorithm, ie. it functions with continuously incoming data.
 * it does not require all the data in the array to be present from the onset.It works well where data is coming in live,
 * or being streamed in.
 * time complexity - O(n^2)
 * space complexity - O(1)
