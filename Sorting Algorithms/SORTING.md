# Big O of Sorting Algorithms

| Algorithm       |Time complexity (Best) | Time complexity (Average) | Time complexity (Worst) | Space complexity |
|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Bubble sort     | O(n)                  | O(n^2)                    | O(n^2)                  | O(1)             |
| Insertion sort  | O(n)                  | O(n^2)                    | O(n^2)                  | O(1)             |
| Selection sort  | O(n^2)                | O(n^2)                    | O(n^2)                  | O(1)             |

Insertion and Selection sorts perform well with nearly sorted data/ input arrays. These 3 basic sorting algorithms also perform well on smaller data sets.
