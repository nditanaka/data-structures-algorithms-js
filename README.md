## Big O notation

There are three different notations:

- big O - worst case. this is most important because in software engineering we typically plan for the worst case.
- big Theta (Θ) - time complexity is the same for all n
- big Omega (Ω) - best case

The most common runtimes from fastest to slowest:

1. constant O(1)
2. logarithmic O(log N)
3. linear O(N)
4. log linear O(N log N)
5. polynomial O(N^X) where X is some constant eg. quadratic O(N^2) and cubic O(N^3)
6. exponential O(2^N)
7. factorial O(N!)
